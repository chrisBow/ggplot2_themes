## ggplot2_themes

A selection of themes for ggplot2. They're not designed to perhaps be the most fancy or the most striking, but they are designed to - hopefully - be useable.

Example plots using all these themes can be found in [this article on Medium][1].

If you come across any themes that you want to use, or take as the starting point for your own theme, I'll be incredibly flattered.
